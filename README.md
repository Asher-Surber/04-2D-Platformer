# 04-2D-Platformer
Project 4 for IUB MSCH-C220 SP 21, 3/21-5/21

The base of a very simple 2D platformer game set on an alien planet, where you must collect all of the gem-like keys to unlock gates on your way to the citadel.

## Implementation
Godot Engine 3.2.3
Basic controls: W-jump/double jump, A-left, D-right, Esc-quit, O-save, L-load
Enemies patrol solid ground, was not able to implement attacking or dying/combat.
Two difficult platforming levels, with four gems to collect (only on the first, was not able to get to second).
Very plain HUD showing gem count and a win notification (won't show unless gems were implemented in and collected by the end of level 2.
Save and load.
